## About Me ##
- - - -

Hello, this is Matt Kopay from Aurora, Colorado. I am a prospective MA in Web Design student at UF. I'm very excited to be back at the University of Florida taking classes! Believe it or not I am new to Git and GitHub as most of my coding projects have been on my own. Not used to collaborating on scripts. 

<br/>
My undergraduate degree was in Engineering Technology (ET) from the University of Delaware in 2002. I also worked for the University via their Media and Information Services (MIS) Department. In 2020, I obtained a Masters certificate from Colorado State University inÂ Business Management.

<br/>
I've been working in the IT industry for close to 20 years, including working for Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Apple, Xcel Energy, and have obtained a Senior IT Engineering role with an Australian FinTech company called 

[Finder.com](http://www.finder.com/ "Finder.com").

I am hoping to learn more about web design to work on design projects at my company.

## Career Goals ##
---- 

Currently I am seeking to learn more about Web Design and web design strategies so that I can publish my own corporate website and try to "rank" on google via SEO - Search Engine Optimization.
I also hope to be able to assist current developers at my current company Finder.

I'm really just looking forward to understanding how this thing called the internet really works behind the scenes so I can stay up to date in my knowledge to make better life choices.
